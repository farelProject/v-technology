          "content": "The error messages indicate that the Debian 'buster' repositories are not providing Release files, which prevents `apt-get update` from working. This can happen because 'buster' is an older release and might not be actively maintained. To fix this, you can try updating your Debian sources to a supported release (e.g., bullseye or bookworm) or use a different base image in your Dockerfile.\n\nAdditionally, the Dockerfile command combines multiple operations into a single `RUN` instruction, which can cause issues. It's better to separate the `apt-get update` and `apt-get install` commands.\n\nHere's a corrected `Dockerfile`:\n\n```dockerfile\nFROM debian:latest\n\nRUN apt-get update && \\\n    apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends ffmpeg imagemagick webp && \\\n    apt-get upgrade -y && \\\n    rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*\n```\n\nKey changes and explanations:\n\n*   **`FROM debian:latest`**: Consider using a specific supported Debian version such as `debian:bullseye` or `debian:bookworm`. Using `latest` can sometimes point to an unsupported version.\n*   **Separate commands**: I combined the install command into a single line for better readability.\n*   **`--no-install-recommends`**: Added this option to reduce the size of the image by skipping the installation of recommended packages.\n*   **Clean up**: The `rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*` command cleans up the apt lists to reduce the image size.",
