The `print()` function then displays the value of `width`.\n\n**JavaScript:**\n```javascript\nlet width = 10;\nconsole.log(width);\n```\n*Explanation:* This code declares a variable named `width` using the `let` keyword and assigns it the value 10. The `console.log()` function then prints the value of `width` to the console.\n\n**C++:**\n```c++\n#include <iostream>\n\nint main() {\n  int width = 10;\n  std::cout << width << std::endl;\n  return 0;\n}\n```\n*Explanation:* This C++ code declares an integer variable `width` and initializes it to 10. It then uses `std::cout` to print the value of `width` to the console, followed by a newline character (`std::endl`).\n\n**C#:**\n```csharp\nusing System;\n\npublic class Example {\n  public static void Main(string[] args) {\n    int width = 10;\n    Console.WriteLine(width);\n  }\n}\n```\n*Explanation:* This C# code declares an integer variable `width` and initializes it to 10.  `Console.WriteLine()` is used to print the value of `width` to the console.\n\n**Go:**\n```go\npackage main\n\nimport \"fmt\"\n\nfunc main() {\n\twidth := 10\n\tfmt.Println(width)\n}\n```\n*Explanation:* This Go code declares a variable `width` using the short variable declaration `:=` and assigns it the value 10.
